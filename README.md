## The BOS database system should host a number of indispensable details. 

# Athelete Table
    A key part of implementing this successfully is making it easy for users to find athletes and sporting events. The system must allow users to easily search for athletes by name, and browse sporting events that have been scheduled at various dates and times at different venues. You need to track information about all the sporting events that are to be held, including who the participants are (including their home country and birth.

# sport event table:
    What the events are, and what the results are. The types of information to be recorded for an event encompass the name, which sport the event is for, the result type (whether it is time-based or score-based), however the system needs to cater for Brisbane 2024 Olympics only excluding all other past nor future Olympics games. 

# Sporting official table: 
    You need to keep a record of the sporting officials who run the events (referee games, judge performance, awarding medals), so that we know who is doing what at each event.

# Venue table
    Each sporting event takes place at specific times at a venue, located in or near to Brisbane, and across Queensland. As many as fourteen new sports venues in Brisbane, seven on the Gold Coast and five on the Sunshine Coast will receive government funding as part of major development for this international event. This includes the $1-billion redevelopment of the existing cricket stadium in Woolloongabba, Brisbane, to serve as the main stadium featuring the athletics games, and more prominently the Olympics opening and closing ceremonies.

# Accommodation table:
    Athletes and officials stay at accommodation villages that are spread across the state. Each contingent from each country will be allocated an accommodation village for the entire duration of this event. For both venues and accommodation villages we need to capture the location details, its GPS position (longitude and latitude), build date, build cost, along with a short, memorisable unique name (such as ‘Suncorp Stadium’). Every location should have a specific address in a suburb, several of which may be in the same area, for example, ‘Kangaroo Point’, ‘Fortitude Valley’ and ‘Woolloongabba’ would be in the ‘Inner Brisbane’ area.

# vehicle table:
    A fleet of vehicles will be commissioned for such purpose. Each vehicle will have its own unique alphanumeric code, type (either a van, minibus, or bus) and be built with a fixed capacity. These vehicles will be scheduled to run transfer journeys from one venue to another, at specific arrival and destination times. Athletes and officials will be able to book themselves or be booked onto these journeys, and we need to be able to track these bookings.
